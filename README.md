## About
This is my current portfolio website. The site is fully responsive, it has a designed 404 error page as well.

All the data are stored on Contentful which is a content infrastructure. It is easy to modify the data or add new projects to the portfolio without changing any code. On Contentful there is a content model with 8 fields. When I want to add a new project, I just make a new entry and fill the necessary fields.

I used Context API for the state management. It provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

The website is hosted by Netlify. [Check the portfolio here!](https://zalanzubik.netlify.com/)
